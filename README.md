# Shapes (Java)
This program draws shapes and calculates the shape's area for the user. The shapes the program can draw are a rectangle, circle, and triangle. The user will input the x,y,and z coordinates for the shape, as well as the length (base for the triangle), width (height for triangle), and radius for the circle. The program runs as follows: 

Step 1) The program outputs the menu asking the user for their desired action, draw circle, rectangle, or triangle, print their current list of shapes to the console, or to quit.

Step 2) If the user selects the option to draw a shape, the program will ask the user for the perameters of the shapes.

Step 3) Once the program has gathered the required information from the user, it adds the shape to a list of shapes.

Step 4) The program asks for the users desired action.

Step 5) If the user selects to output the list of shapes they have created, the program will display the shape in the following format: 
      (X, Y, Z) (Area of Circle)
      (X, Y, Z) /Area of Triangle\
      (X, Y, Z) [Area of Rectangle]

Step 6) The program asks for the user's desired input.

Step 7) If the user selects quit, the program outputs with the following message: "Thank you for using the Shape Generator!"
